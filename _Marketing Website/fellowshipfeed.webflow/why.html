            <p><strong>Church is NOT a building</strong>
              <br>The Bible clearly shows us that the “Church” is body of believers. This does not refer to a physical building or even a 501c3 organization. Maintaining a close-knit community is essential to being a Christian and completing our task to preach
              the gospel to all nations. FF is here to boost communication between your church family.</p>

              <br>Fellowship feed will not be replacing the work of the Holy Spirit or the personal discipleship and fellowship of church members. Think of Fellowship Feed as a tool to aid in connection these genuine propellants of the Church.</p>

            <p><strong>Technology is here to stay</strong>
              <br>Technology isn’t a tool to pass aside. It should be harnessed and used by transformed minds for God’s glory. Smartphones, Wifi, tablet PCs, even smart glasses are now embedded into schools, culture, and even the next gen church. Many churches
              are embracing these new tools. The current and older generations might not care for this new tech, but these next generations come fluent.</p>

            <p><strong>Always Free</strong>
              <br>This service is designed to provoke intent &amp; empower communication in church communities. Could you really put a price on that? Lord willing, this service will not have any ads, fees, and will NOT be sold for a profit. It is free of
              charge to anyone. Genuine love typically requires a sacrifice (Just like how our savior died for us.). What a great opportunity to share this resource and serve your church community.</p>
